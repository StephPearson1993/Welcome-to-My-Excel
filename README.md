Iâ€™m currently working on Excel task
-----------------------------------

This is where I completed tasks in excel including in the first Sheet- formatting the columns, 'filter' function, 'SUM' function, 'AVERAGE' function, In sheet 2 i used the '=VLOOKUP' Function, '=CONCATENATE' function and =Count function Then in Sheet 3 I completed the tasks shown within the Document. Then with in the screen shot I analysed a pivot Table to find In which markets does Germany have customers? and What are the most profitable markets by country, age group, and gender?
