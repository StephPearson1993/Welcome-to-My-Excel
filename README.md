## Here you will find an overview the data analysis activities I have completed in Excel. ##

In the sheet ‘Retail_sales_dataset’ add all available data between columns A –N into a ‘table’

Using the ‘filter’ function, filter ‘Age’ to ‘largest to smallest’

Using the ‘SUM’ function, show me the commission total in cell ‘Q7’

Using the ‘AVERAGE’ function, show me the average commission in cell ‘Q8’

Here are some screenshots of my results where I also added the day, month, year and Generation Using a IFS Function.
